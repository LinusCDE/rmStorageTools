# rmStorageTools

**In early Progress**

Based on [rmWebUiTools](https://github.com/LinusCDE/rmWebUiTools).

Docs and other information most likely will think this is using the usb webinterface.

All the scripts should currently work, but may output misleading messages.

The export is done with the amazing and simple to use lib [rmrl](https://github.com/rschroll/rmrl/) from [rschroll](https://github.com/rschroll)!
