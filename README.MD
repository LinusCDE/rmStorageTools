# rmStorageTools

**In early Progress**

Based on [rmWebUiTools](https://github.com/LinusCDE/rmWebUiTools).

Docs and other information most likely will think this is using the usb webinterface.

All the scripts should currently work, but may output misleading messages.

The export is done with the amazing lib [rmrl](https://github.com/rschroll/rmrl/) from [rschroll](https://github.com/rschroll)!
The lib is probably missing a few things (like template backgrounds), but is really cool, easy to use and FAST. (Exported 230 files in under a minute!).
